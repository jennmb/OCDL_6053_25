Objective: My objective for this term is continue with ruby, and finish the excerises in the "Learn Ruby the Hard Way". I hope to be dont with the book and move one to other programming languages. I have a few languages I wish to start; Python, C and C++ (?), Swift, and Android studio. I do not mean to start all of them just one of that list. I have began learn some swift with the website I worked on during the meetup. With Python, I don't know what it is or for what it is used for. Finally C and C++ peaked my intrested because I wish to know about machine code, although I'm not sure which one to start with first.
